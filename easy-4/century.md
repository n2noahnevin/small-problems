# What Century is That?

**Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with `st`, `nd`, `rd`, or `th` as appropriate for that number.**

**New centuries begin in years that end with `01`. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.**

Examples:

```ruby
century(2000) == '20th'
century(2001) == '21st'
century(1965) == '20th'
century(256) == '3rd'
century(5) == '1st'
century(10103) == '102nd'
century(1052) == '11th'
century(1127) == '12th'
century(11201) == '113th'
```

*Algorithm:*

1. Define a new method, `century`, that takes in an integer as an argument and returns a string.
2. The century the integer (year) is in can be calculated with `(year / 100) + 1`.
3. If the last digit is a 1, use `st`. If 2, `nd`, If 3, `rd`. Everything else, `th`.

*Code:*

```ruby
def century(year)
  century = year / 100 + 1
  century -= 1 if year % 100 == 0
  century.to_s + century_suffix(century)
end

def century_suffix(century)
  return 'th' if [11, 12, 13].include?(century % 100)
  last_digit = century % 10

  case last_digit
  when 1 then 'st'
  when 2 then 'nd'
  when 3 then 'rd'
  else 'th'
  end
end

century(2000) == '20th'
century(2001) == '21st'
century(1965) == '20th'
century(256) == '3rd'
century(5) == '1st'
century(10103) == '102nd'
century(1052) == '11th'
century(1127) == '12th'
century(11201) == '113th'
```
