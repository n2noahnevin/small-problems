# Multiplying Two Numbers

**Create a method that takes two arguments, multiplies them together, and returns the result.**

**Example:**

```ruby
multiply(5, 3) == 15
```

---

Note: For the sake of time, the PEDAC process will be skipped over for this example.

*Code:*

```ruby
def multiply(num1, num2)
  num1 * num2
end

multiply(5,3) == 15
```
